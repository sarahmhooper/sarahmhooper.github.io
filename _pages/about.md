**About me.** I’m currently a sixth year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am lucky to be advised by Drs. [Chris Ré](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/) and [Curt Langlotz](https://profiles.stanford.edu/curtis-langlotz), affiliated with Stanford's [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging](https://aimi.stanford.edu/) and the [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/). I am also grateful to be supported by a [Hertz Fellowship](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/the-fellowship/), a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), and a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship in Science and Engineering](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf) as the Texas Instruments Fellow.

**Research interests.** I’m excited by the potential of machine learning to improve healthcare, particularly in settings where access to expertise or resources are limited. Most of my graduate research has focused on developing and evaluating deep learning methods for medical image analysis. Please click here for more info on my research interests. 

**Brief background.** I graduated summa cum laude from Rice University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Global Health Technologies in 2017. At Rice, I worked with Drs. Gary Woods and Behnaam Aazhang in the [Rice Neuroengineering Initiative]](https://neuroengineering.rice.edu/) and with Drs. Rebecca Richards-Kortum and Maria Oden in the [Rice360 Institute for Global Health Technologies](https://www.rice360.rice.edu/). During  undergrad, I spent time at the Polytechnic University of Malawi through an internship with Rice360 learning about healthcare technology and accessibility. I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2020. During my graduate career, I interned with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and have enjoyed ongoing research collaboration with the NIH, specifically the NHLBI’s Imaging AI Program.
